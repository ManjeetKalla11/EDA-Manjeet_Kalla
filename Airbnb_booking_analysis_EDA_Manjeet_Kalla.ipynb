For example, entire homes/apartments could be marketed to families or groups willing to pay more for privacy, while shared and private rooms could appeal to solo travelers or those on a budget.\n",

        "####Room Type Demand Insight:\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding that shared rooms are priced the lowest, and entire homes the highest, can help businesses (especially Airbnb hosts) determine what types of properties to invest in based on their target audience and profit margin goals.

        "The fact that there are many high-priced outliers in the \"Entire home/apt\" category may indicate oversupply in the luxury market. If too many properties are priced excessively high, without providing sufficient value, hosts may struggle to maintain high occupancy rates. This could eventually lead to reduced bookings and stagnation.\n",

        "####Affordability Gap:\n",
        "\n",
        " If the focus remains primarily on high-priced entire homes, it could lead to an affordability gap in the market. Budget-conscious travelers might opt for more affordable listings from competitors, resulting in reduced demand for high-priced homes. The growth of the \"budget\" segment (private/shared rooms) might be neglected, leading to missed opportunities for capturing a wider audience.\n",

        "\n",
        " Listings priced significantly higher than the median may alienate guests or damage a host’s reputation if the experience does not justify the price. These outliers could also lead to negative reviews, as customers expect premium service for premium prices. Without proper management, this could harm long-term growth."

        "\n",
        "Staten Island's Moderate Pricing: Staten Island's prices are somewhat higher than the Bronx and Queens but still much lower than Manhattan. This might suggest a more niche demand for stays in Staten Island, with fewer listings but potentially higher quality options.\n",

        "Optimal Pricing for Manhattan Hosts: Hosts in Manhattan can leverage the insight that they already command the highest prices.

This could lead to higher occupancy rates and guest satisfaction, enhancing their profitability.\n",

By improving listings or marketing the borough more effectively, Airbnb could drive more demand, creating new business opportunities for hosts and the platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "Negative Growth Considerations:\n",
        "While the chart mostly points toward positive insights, a few aspects could lead to challenges or negative growth if not addressed properly:\n",
        "\n",
        "Potential Saturation in Manhattan: Since Manhattan already has the highest prices, there may be a saturation point where higher prices start to deter travelers, especially budget-conscious ones. If demand decreases due to overly high prices or an excess of high-end listings, hosts could face lower occupancy rates, leading to negative growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Limited Growth in Bronx and Queens: While Bronx and Queens are affordable, they may suffer from a perception of being less desirable compared to more central areas like Manhattan or Brooklyn. If Airbnb hosts in these areas don't focus on improving guest experiences, offering competitive services, or addressing safety concerns, the potential for growth could be limited, stunting future business expansion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Staten Island Price Fluctuation: The high variability in prices in Staten Island could indicate instability in the market. If prices fluctuate too much, it might lead to inconsistent demand or customer dissatisfaction, as travelers may not be able to predict costs or value consistently. This could result in negative feedback or reduced bookings over time, leading to negative growth."

        "There are several outliers with extremely high prices (ranging from $2000 to $10,000). These outliers are spread across both low and high availability days. These listings may represent luxury properties or exclusive experiences that are rented either for short durations (e.g., specific events) or are kept available year-round for select guests.\n",
        "4. High Availability for Low-Priced Listings:\n",
        "Many low-priced listings (below $500) tend to be available for nearly all 365 days. This might indicate that budget-friendly listings are designed to stay open throughout the year, likely to cater to high demand from budget travelers or those looking for short-term stays.\n",
